# Let us create a discipline
# to simulate a mass damper defined in a FMU model
# from 0 to 1 second with a time step of 0.1 millisecond:
#
# ![ ](../../../../../images/mass_damper.png)
#
# We only use the mass of the sliding mass [kg]
# and the spring constant [N/m] as inputs
# and the position of the mass [m] as output.

    final_time=1.0,
    time_step=0.0001,
)

# %%
# Firstly,
# we simulate the FMU with the default input values,
# and in particular a constant value for the mass:
discipline.execute()

# %%
# and store the time evolution of its position:
default_y_evolution = discipline.local_data["y"]
print(discipline.local_data["mass.m"])
# %%
# Then,
# we repeat the experiment with a custom time series for the mass,
# characterized by a sharp change after 0.5 seconds.

# %%
# Lastly,
# we use a chart to compare the positions of the mass:
plt.plot(discipline.time, default_y_evolution, label="Default")
plt.plot(discipline.time, discipline.local_data["y"], label="Custom")
plt.xlabel("Time [s]")
plt.ylabel("Amplitude [m]")
