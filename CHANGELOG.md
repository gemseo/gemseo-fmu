# Develop

## Added

- The default behavior of `.FMUDiscipline`{.interpreted-text
    role="class"} is either simulating until the final time or during a
    time step; it can also restart from initial time after each
    execution.
- `.FMUDiscipline.execute`{.interpreted-text role="class"} can change
    the behavior of the `.FMUDiscipline`{.interpreted-text role="class"}
    temporarily, to simulate during a given simulation time, with a
    different time step or from initial time.
- `.TimeSeries`{.interpreted-text role="class"} allows to specify
    inputs as time series.
- `gemseo-fmu.use_cases`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} contains use
    cases, either defined as `.FMUDiscipline`{.interpreted-text
    role="class"} or simply as FMU files; use
    `get_fmu_file_path`{.interpreted-text role="func"} to get a FMU file
    path easily.

## Changed

- The `.FMUDiscipline`{.interpreted-text role="class"} relies on the
    library [FMPy](https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMPy).
- `.FMUDiscipline`{.interpreted-text role="class"} is in
    `gemseo-fmu.disciplines`{.interpreted-text role="mod"}.
