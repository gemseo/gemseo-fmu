# Version 2.0.0 (December 2023)

## Added

- Support for Python 3.11.
- The default behavior of
  [FMUDiscipline][gemseo_fmu.disciplines.fmu_discipline.FMUDiscipline]
  is either simulating until the final time or during a time step;
  it can also restart from initial time after each execution.
- [FMUDiscipline.execute][gemseo_fmu.disciplines.fmu_discipline.FMUDiscipline.execute]
  can change the behavior of the
  [FMUDiscipline][gemseo_fmu.disciplines.fmu_discipline.FMUDiscipline]
  temporarily, to simulate during a given simulation time, with a
  different time step or from initial time.
- [TimeSeries][gemseo_fmu.disciplines.time_series.TimeSeries]
  allows to specify inputs as time series.
- [gemseo-fmu.problems][gemseo_fmu.problems] contains use cases,
  either defined as [FMUDiscipline][gemseo_fmu.disciplines.fmu_discipline.FMUDiscipline]
  or simply as FMU files;
  use [get_fmu_file_path][gemseo_fmu.problems.fmu_files.get_fmu_file_path]
  to get a FMU file path easily.
- [DoStepFMUDiscipline][gemseo_fmu.disciplines.do_step_fmu_discipline.DoStepFMUDiscipline]
  is an [FMUDiscipline][gemseo_fmu.disciplines.fmu_discipline.FMUDiscipline]
  whose execution is only one time step ahead.
- [DoStepFMUDiscipline][gemseo_fmu.disciplines.time_stepping_system.TimeSteppingSystem]
  is a system of static and time-stepping disciplines
  which executes them sequentially at each time step.

## Changed

- The [FMUDiscipline][gemseo_fmu.disciplines.fmu_discipline.FMUDiscipline]
  relies on the library [FMPy](https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMPy).
- [FMUDiscipline][gemseo_fmu.disciplines.fmu_discipline.FMUDiscipline]
  is in [gemseo-fmu.disciplines][gemseo_fmu.disciplines].

## Removed
