## FMU discipline

The [functional mock-up interface (FMI)](https://fmi-standard.org/)
is a popular free standard to exchange dynamic simulation models.
This standard defines the notion of functional mock-up unit (FMU)
through a ZIP file containg a mix of XML files, binaries and C code.
GEMSEO-FMU proposes
the [FMUDiscipline][gemseo_fmu.disciplines.fmu_discipline.FMUDiscipline]
as a particular [MDODiscipline][gemseo.core.discipline.MDODiscipline]
to simulate an FMU model.
