# Co-simulation

A
[TimeSteppingSystem][gemseo_fmu.disciplines.time_stepping_system.TimeSteppingSystem]
is an
[MDODiscipline][gemseo.core.discipline.MDODiscipline]
defined by a system of static and time-stepping disciplines:

- a static discipline computes an output $y$ at time $t_k$
  from an input $x$ at time $t_k$, i.e. $y(t_k)=f(x(t_k))$,
- a time-stepping discipline computes an output $y$ at time $t_k$
  from an input $y$ at time $t_k$ and its state $s$ at time $t_k$,
  i.e. $y(t_k)=f(x(t_k),s(t_k),t_k)$.

At each time step $t_k$,
the
[TimeSteppingSystem][gemseo_fmu.disciplines.time_stepping_system.TimeSteppingSystem]
executes a collection of such disciplines one after the other.

!!! note
    The order of execution is the user one.
    Future versions of `gemseo-fmu` should implement advanced strategies
    based on the
    [MDOCouplingStructure][gemseo.core.coupling_structure.MDOCouplingStructure]
    of the disciplines.

## Instantiation

The instantiation of a
[TimeSteppingSystem][gemseo_fmu.disciplines.time_stepping_system.TimeSteppingSystem]
only requires a list of disciplines, final time and a time step:

```python
from gemseo_fmu.disciplines.time_stepping_system import TimeSteppingSystem
from gemseo_fmu.disciplines.dynamic_fmu_discipline import DynamicFMUDiscipline
from gemseo.disciplines.analytic import AnalyticDiscipline

disciplines = [
    "file_path.fmu",
    DynamicFMUDiscipline("other_file_path.fmu"),
    AnalyticDiscipline({"y":"2*x"})
]
system = TimeSteppingSystem(disciplines, 1, 0.1)
```

The disciplines can be either an FMU file path,
a static discipline or a dynamic discipline
and will be executed in parallel.

## Restart

By default,
an execution starts from the initial time.
Set `restart` to `False` if you want to restart from the initial time.

## Time stepping

By default,
an execution simulates from the initial time to the final time.
Set `do_step` to `True` if you want to simulate with only one time step.

## Time step

By default,
the time-stepping disciplines use the time step passed at instantiation.
Set `apply_time_step_to_disciplines` to `False`  if you want to use their specific time steps.
