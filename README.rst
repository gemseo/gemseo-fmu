GEMSEO-FMU is a `GEMSEO <https://gemseo.readthedocs.io>`_ plugin for loading, interacting, and simulating Functional Mockup Unit models (FMUs).
FMUs are widely used by the simulation community and can be generated by over 170 tools such as Dymola, OpenModelica, CATIA, ANSYS, LS-DYNA, or MATLAB (see the full list here https://www.fmi-standard.org/tools).

GEMSEO-FMU enables the integration and exploitation of FMUs in a Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) context, via GEMSEO.
For that, it wraps the FMU model into a GEMSEO discipline named FMUDiscipline.

GEMSEO-FMU relies on the `FMPy <https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMPy>`_ library for loading the FMU models, setting the model parameters and evaluating model equations.
Model Exchange and Co-Simulation types as well as versions 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 of the FMI standard are supported by FMPy, and so by GEMSEO-FMU.
