Functional Mock-Up Unit models GEMSEO pluging (GEMSEO-FMU)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

GEMSEO-FMU is a `GEMSEO <https://gemseo.readthedocs.io>`_ plugin for loading, interacting, and simulating FMU dynamic models. It enables the integration and exploitation of FMU models in a Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) context, via GEMSEO.

FMUs are widely used by the simulation community and can be generated by over 170 tools such as Dymola, OpenModelica, CATIA, ANSYS, LS-DYNA, or MATLAB (see the full list here https://www.fmi-standard.org/tools).

Model Exchange models and Co-Simulation models (versions 1.0 and 2.0) are supported. 

GEMSEO-FMU relies on the `PyFMI <https://github.com/modelon-community/PyFMI>`_ library for loading the FMU models, setting the model parameters and evaluating model equations. 

GEMSEO-FMU translates the FMU model into a GEMSEO discipline named FMUDiscipline, exploitable in MDO processes. Its usage is straightforward (see the examples folder).


Installation
------------

To install GEMSEO, you need a Python environment. We strongly recommend to use `Anaconda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_ to create a dedicated
environment for the GEMSEO-FMU plugin.

Anaconda is a free multi-platform Python distribution (for commercial use and redistribution) that facilitates the
installation of Python and non-Python packages, since it handles pre-compiled packages.
Furthermore, it does not require any administrator privilege. You may install Anaconda and learn how to use it.

The following steps must be followed to carry out a full installation.

1) For Python 3, install the full feature set in an anaconda environment named gemseo-fmu for python 3.9 with

conda create –n gemseo-fmu python=3.9

2) Then, install the package pyfmi via conda with

conda install –c conda-forge pyfmi

3) To continue, install the package gemseo (with full features) via Pypi:

pip install gemseo[all]

4) Finally, the plugin gemseo-fmu must be installed (from the gemseo-fmu delivery directory) with:

pip install .


Test the installation
------------

Basic test:

To check that the installation is successful, try to import the module:

python -c "import gemseo_fmu"


Generic examples
------------

Many examples are available to illustrate the main features of GEMSEO-FMU.
You can download a Python script, execute it and experiment to test the installation.
