Functional Mock-Up Unit models GEMSEO pluging (GEMSEO-FMU)
==========================================================

GEMSEO-FMU is a `GEMSEO <https://gemseo.readthedocs.io>`_ plugin for loading, interacting, and simulating FMU dynamic models.
It enables the integration and exploitation of FMU models in a Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) context, via GEMSEO.

FMUs are widely used by the simulation community and can be generated by over 170 tools such as Dymola, OpenModelica, CATIA, ANSYS, LS-DYNA, or MATLAB (see the full list here https://www.fmi-standard.org/tools).

Model Exchange models and Co-Simulation models (versions 1.0 and 2.0) are supported.

GEMSEO-FMU relies on the `PyFMI <https://github.com/modelon-community/PyFMI>`_ library for loading the FMU models, setting the model parameters and evaluating model equations.

GEMSEO-FMU translates the FMU model into a GEMSEO discipline named FMUDiscipline, exploitable in MDO processes.
Its usage is straightforward (see the examples folder).


Installation
------------

To install GEMSEO, you need an anaconda environment because PyFMI is onlyu maintained for anaconda.
The following steps must be followed:

.. code-block:: console

   conda create –n gemseo-fmu -c conda-forge python=3.9 pyfmi
   conda activate gemseo-fmu
   pip install gemseo-fmu


Generic examples
----------------

Many examples are available to illustrate the main features of GEMSEO-FMU.
See in the examples directory.


Documentation
